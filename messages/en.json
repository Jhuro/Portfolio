    "about": "I am a systems engineer who graduated from the Universidad Piloto de Colombia, passionate about software development and a person who likes to learn something new every day and hone my skills with experience. During university, I worked mainly with languages ​​such as Java, JavaScript, HTML and SQL, but my own initiative to continue studying and developing projects has led me to learn other tools. I am aware of how fast the world moves and how volatile it can be, so I try to stay up to date to adapt to certain scenarios.",
